# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database
# with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
# Write the code in a way that can be executed multiple times without duplicating the information.
#
# For example:
#
# Country.create(name: "Chile") # BAD
# Country.find_or_create_by(name: "Chile") # GOOD
#
